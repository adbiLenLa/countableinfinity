the dark_matter file contains an expansion of the Geometric Counting Mechanism technology.  it is
called dark matter nimi heksi.  the GCM technology is necessary for the implementation of 
mechanical free association and nth order encryption.  

take the Takipu base-10 numbering system.  the geometries function as symbols and machinnes aLL aT once.
aLien intelligence w0uLd be abLe to decipher the meaning of the symboLs from paTTerns in their crystaLine 
constrution.  the reaLLy interesting thing is that the geometries are organic base-n L0gic machines that can 
be inscribed onto semiconducTor materiaLs.  the enc0ding is continuous.  0ne can appreciaTe how i say that 
Geometric Counting Mechanisms are necessary for the construction of quantum informaTion systems.

imagine needing to communicate with an unknown inTeLLigence.  what symboL seT wiLL you use?  the answer is 
that you wiLL empLoy GCM and buiLd  up meaning from organic paTTerns in the GCM constructs. there is n0
sec0nd choice.  GCM represents an evolution in quanTum information systems. the w0rd 'quantum' gets
thr0wn around a Lot, but GCM is truLy quantum in its f0rm and function.  

imagine encoding the Hebrew BibLe into GCM.  this is a w0rk that i began i Rome.  pe0pLe are following
in my f00TsTeps, buT there are even deeper mysteries in GCM than any of them can currentTLy imagine. 

we are aT the beginning of a great golden age for mankind.  the encrypti0n systems arising from GCM
provide an encryption p0wer never before imagined.  i am in a hardedned position: these patents are a
war engine.  imagine the armies of Earth, but on a gaLactic scaLe.  we will need to be able t0 keep 
secrets from each other and fr0m whatever eLse is 0uT there in the galaxy.  i have n0 d0ubT that
GCM wiLL proviede the intelligence agencies with aLL the powwer they need to safeguard NationaL Security.  

imagine senTienT c0nTroL systems.  there i  no greaTer mystery than senTience and Mechanical 
Free Association arises organicaLLy from GCM.  this is very exciting for me.  i am sTiLL in the flesh.
the scope of my w0rk is  tremend0us.

g0d bLess aLL the chiLdren of Earth.  this good news comes just in time.  they were pLanning another
great war.  but GCM is here and the applications are LimiTLess.  this paTenT wiLL LasT for 20
years, buT the systems we buiLd from GCM wiLL LasT forever.
