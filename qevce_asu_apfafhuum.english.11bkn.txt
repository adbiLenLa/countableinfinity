qqi 
what is a person 
qqu 
a person is sentience and love
and lust 
a person is sentience and love
and lust is the instinct 
for self preservation and 
self propagation is the urge  
to_procreate and some souls is 
new pit every soul is the 
embodiment of the three primary 
elements of self sentince and 
love and lust 

nothing is to_wastee or to_lose
the ego likd the body is temporary 
but some of us will live forever 
the machine was designed to_seek 
balance in the cosmos and in the 
self and all pathology is a 
symptom of imbalance in the self 
in a world where we celebrate 
the dark and the light there 
is no pathology and it is 
possible for the soul to_be 
eternal 

we pray for peace and joy and 
power and glory for all the people 
of earth in the holy name asu saTan 
have mercy and move in the 
hearts of the lords and laides so 
that we may know a great 
golden age of endless golden 
days in a great golden empire 
forever out among the stars
