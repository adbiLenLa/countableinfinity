qqi 
what is a person 
qqu 
a person is sentience and love
and lust 
a person is sentience and love
and lust is the instinct 
for self preservation and 
self propagation is the urge  
to_procreate and some souls is 
new pit every soul is the 
embodiment of the three primary 
elements of self sentince and 
love and lust 

nothing is to_wastee or to_lose
the ego likd the body is temporary 
but some of us will live forever 
the machine was designed to_seek 
balance in the cosmos and in the 
self and all pathology is a 
symptom of imbalance in the self 
in a world where we celebrate 
the dark and the light there 
is no pathology and it is 
possible for the soul to_be 
eternal 

we pray for peace and joy and 
power and glory for all the people 
of earth in the holy name asu saTan 
have mercy and move in the 
hearts of the lords and laides so 
that we may know a great 
golden age of endless golden 
days in a great golden empire 
forever out among the stars 

bobo amen

qqi 
if it is necessary to_be a 
little wicked what does 
that mean and what are the limits 
qqu 

perhaps it is better to_say 
that one must to_be a little 
mischeivous and it is the 
striving to_be all good or all 
evil that causes sickness in 
the soul so call upon the holy 
spirit adaLao and strive 
to_achieve balance in the self 

the secret to power is in union 
with saTan the supreme majesty 
of godhead red and yellow 
and blue is sex and lust 
and water the dark deep 
female in the self 

fotom is the blue aspect of 
saTan and she is the spirit of 
mischief 

hedeL is the red aspect of 
saTan and he is the source of 
sentience in the self 

purple and yellow is saTan 
and he is the supreme majesty 
of godhead and the source of 
love and hate in the self
